    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used perseverance when I tried to add a border to the container but i couldn't figure out what was going wrong so I kept trying to find a solution and eventually i came to one.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the different types of edgings for a box for example; border, padding and margin.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I showed independence this week by finding out how to add a folder to github because i removed the default blog post but it deleted the "_posts" folder.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my blog and tried to see if i could add anything to enhance it’s appearance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged with the task at hand as i worked my way through the set of instructions.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think my learning could have gone better if i tried to investigate how to make the container have a picture border. I also think that it would have been better if i had decorated the header a bit more.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I could improve my learning by being curious to find out what each part of the “style.css”  file did, and how i can adapt them to enhance the visual appearance of my blog. I could also try out different colour schemes to see if that made it more visually appealing.</td>
