For the past few days I have been working on a way to encode and decode messages so that data thieves cannot access personal data. I started with a simple program that moves letters along the alphabet by a certain value. This is called a caesar cipher. I then added a factor of randomness, instead of the user picking the key, a random number would be generated. I finally added an input for your name, so that you can only decode the message if you have the key and the name of the person who encoded it.
