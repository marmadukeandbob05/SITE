**Repl.it Classroom**

Over the past few days, I have made a repl.it classroom and I am helping at least 6 other people learn python. Teaching other people also helps the teacher, as they widen their knowledge of the language. Here are a few of the assignments and a link to my Classroom.

[Classroom](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/48090)

[Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup (and Unicorns)](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/48090/assignments/736157)

(If you have looked at the last one, you will know that I try to make them entertaining as well as teaching about the language)
